        <h2>the longer story</h2>
          <p>Early in my musical career, my primary focus became trying to figure out how to better engage people in a field that was struggling to evolve with the changing needs of audiences. In an effort to explore new ways to innovate, I co-founded an ensemble called Conduit, where I also played clarinet from 2017-2020. For two of those years, Conduit was in residence at the Frost School of Music at University of Miami with a $180,000 grant from Knight Foundation that I proposed and secured. In this residency, we were experimenting with a new design thinking framework for performing arts professionals called Audience Experience Design (AXD), which I created in conjunction with Siggi Bachmann at New World Symphony in Miami Beach. We focused on building AXD through the creation of performing arts experiences for millennial audiences, which resulted in a performance experience called Care. As part of our design work, we also prototyped the very beginning of an app called Ensemble to help make concert-going more social.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Before Conduit, I played three seasons as a Clarinet Fellow at New World Symphony. While playing two or three concerts a week, I designed and produced two live performance experiences, DIMENSIONS and transmuse. DIMENSIONS was an interactive performance geared toward a younger-than-average audience that had no previous experience with classical music. This program empowered audience members to explore many different ways of listening through the orchestra's favorite pieces of music through extramusical creative activity including writing, drawing, and crafting paper models in order to discover their own pathway into classical music. I spoke about this project and the (unexpectedly) evolving nature of classical music in my TEDx talk and at the Classical:NEXT conference in Rotterdam, both in 2017. My final project at New World, transmuse was a musical experience created in collaboration with transgender community in South Florida to celebrate the trans experience, sourcing stories from indviduals who identify as trans and fusing them with music to create a space to bring the community together. I collaborated with Siggi on both projects, and as each had a strong focus on designing the events through the eyes of our audiences, this collaboration led to our creation of Audience Experience Design.</p>

          <p>During my time in Miami, I also performed two seasons as the bass clarinetist of Nu Deco Ensemble, Miami‚Äôs 21st century genre-bending orchestra, which performs original works, classics, and collaborations with artists such as Ben Folds, Kishi Bashi, and Jacob Collier. In addition to performing, I wrote Nu Deco's blog posts, drafted many of their grant applications, and consulted them on the usability of their website. I've facilitated design thinking workshops at Venture Caf√© Miami, Maven Leadership Collective, New World Symphony, and University of Miami‚Äôs Frost School of Music. As an undergraduate, I was one of twenty students to be awarded a Morse Teaching Artist Fellowship, with which I taught music to two diverse clsses of third graders in New York City public schools during the 2014-15 academic year. As a performer, I played regularly in New York as a freelance clarinetist and in summer festivals such as the Aspen Music Festival, Colorado Music Festival, Lucerne Festival Academy, ChamberFest Dubuque, and Madison New Music Festival. I received my Bachelor of Music from The Juilliard School and an Artist Diploma from University of Miami.</p>
